# Application components

## Overview

This document describes different components in the web application(Ruby part). It's not complete, and could be added if further functionality is required during the development.

Close communication is required between team members to define the api between different modules.

## Main app

A place to put different modules together. Does not contain any code itself.

## Web page handout

Actual hand out web pages. This includes retrieving data from data base, display website from the views, etc. It's the centre of the project.

## Model (Database access)

Process request from the main app and return the data stored in database.
